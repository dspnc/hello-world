# hello-world

## I am learning about markdown

### This project exists for me to practice markdown as I learn more about GitHub and Git.

**Spencer** is my name
*Learning how to code* is the game

> It's not the man underneath, but what you do that defines you

1. Practice coding every single day
2. Don't get discouraged by the feeling of imposter syndrome or overwhelming information to digest
3. Take it one step at a time

-I am adamant about taking this new direction in life and sticking with it
-I **WILL** become a web developer and find a job in the field
-I will adopt a mindset of constantly learning that I will take with me through bootcamp and beyond

'code' in markdown goes between single quotes

horizontal rules should have blank lines between them
